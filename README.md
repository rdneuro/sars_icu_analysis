# Analysis of Covid-19 Severe Subjects Multimodal Neuroimaging Dataset
Code for analysis and insight tailored to "UFSC SARS-CoV-2 ICU Multimodal Neuroimaging Dataset".
Nonetheless, all functions will work with any set of structural and functional connectivity matrices and, sometimes, a rs-fMRI timeseries.

In an eventuallity of wanting to install the library (personally I do not recommend, because is an active development environment, full of bugs), please, create a conda environment with python=3.11 pinned ("conda create -n sars -c conda-forge python=3.11"), activate the environmente ("conda activate sars") and, at the root folder of the repository, install the library by using "pip install -e ." at the main directory. It will allow you to edit the code also, as you need.
And maybe you will have some fun with connectivity matrices and timeseries, because it's the main objective of these lines of code.

Sadly, you will not see an elucidative tutorial and beautiful and carefully tought "read the docs" as I wish you will - I truly admire people with that level of altruism and zeal for the code. But at this point I don't have the time to work, make my doctorate's research projects happen, code and make the documentation. There's not even time for a wife or to assemble and drive drones.
Maybe I'll ask for any IA, based on the writted code, synthetize a provisory documentation, it's a tought.

in case of any doubt, however, email-me: r.debona@ufrj.br.
I may take a while to reply, but I always respond.

Sincerely,
